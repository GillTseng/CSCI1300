/*
    This function implements the logic to find the difference between the radius
    of all the planets in the system.
    Notes:
        * having more or less outputs means that your logic is not quite correct.
        * do not hard code the cout statements; use a smart logic instead.
        * use fabs() to compute the absolute value of the difference (do it either in your impementation of
          radiusDifference(planet,planet) or use it after you return the function call to radiusDifference(planet,planet)
        * your output should have the following structure:
            cout<<"Radius difference between planet " <<  <<" and planet "<< <<
                    " is => "<< <<endl;
        * for 5 planets you should have 10 outputs.
